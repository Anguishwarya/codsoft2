            <li>Dr. Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam was an Indian scientist and statesman who served as the 11th President of India from 2002 to 2007. He was born on 15 October 1931 in Rameswaram, Tamil Nadu, and his life journey is an inspiration to millions.</li><br>
            <li>Dr. Kalam was known as the "Missile Man of India" for his contributions to India's ballistic missile and space rocket technology. He played a pivotal role in the Pokhran-II nuclear tests in 1998, which established India as a nuclear power.</li><br>
            <li>His vision for India's development extended beyond science and technology. He was a passionate advocate for education, particularly for the youth of the nation. He believed that education was the key to unlocking India's potential as a global leader.</li><br>
            <li>One of Dr. Kalam's most famous quotes is:</li><br>
            <blockquote class="quote" style="font-size: 2.5rem;"><b> "Dream, Dream, Dream. Dreams transform into thoughts and thoughts result in action."</b></blockquote><br><br>
